# Rank4Sats

Rank4Sats is a platform that enables businesses to promote their websites for a small fee in satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin), while offering an exciting opportunity for lucky visitors to earn satoshis for being the first to access these websites.

Businesses can list their websites on Rank4Sats, pay a fee in satoshis to have their website featured, and when a visitor is the first to access a newly listed website, they are rewarded with satoshis.

## Key Features

- **Promote Your Website**: Businesses can pay a small fee in satoshis to rank their website on our platform and attract traffic.
- **Earn Satoshis**: Visitors who are the first to visit a newly listed website will be rewarded with satoshis.
- **Transparent Listings**: The website lists businesses that have paid to be featured and displays whether the first visitor has already claimed the reward.
- **Secure Payments**: All transactions are handled securely using the Lightning Network.
  
## How It Works

1. **Businesses Register Websites**: 
   - Businesses can enter their website URL on the platform and pay a small fee in satoshis to have their site listed.
   
2. **Visitors Try Their Luck**: 
   - Visitors can browse the list of featured websites. If a visitor is the first to visit a new website, they earn a reward in satoshis.

3. **Rewarding First Visitors**: 
   - The first visitor to access a website receives a fixed amount of satoshis, incentivizing early clicks on new website listings.

4. **Continuous Listings and Opportunities**:
